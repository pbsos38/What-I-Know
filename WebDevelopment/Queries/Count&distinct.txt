SELECT DISTINCT Examples
The following SQL statement selects only the DISTINCT values from the "Country" column in the "Customers" table:

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;



The following SQL statement lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;




Note: The example above will not work in Firefox and Microsoft Edge! Because COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) is not supported in Microsoft 
Access databases. Firefox and Microsoft Edge are using Microsoft Access in our examples.

Here is the workaround for MS Access:

SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);
