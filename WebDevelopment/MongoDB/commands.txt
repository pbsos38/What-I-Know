to run mongodb there are 2 steps
1) to run database open a powershell terminal at "D:\programs\mongodb\bin" and run a command: ".\mongod.exe --dbpath D:\programs\mongodb\data\db"
2) to connect mongodb to database open 2nd powershell terminal at same location and run mongo.exe // now we are connected to mongodb

In 2nd terminal we are going to run commands

show dbs // to get list of all databases
use {dbName} // eg. use admin // this will switch to admin database if there is now database with that name then new db will be created

////////collections == table of mysql /////////////////
show collections // this will show all the table or collections inside the db
